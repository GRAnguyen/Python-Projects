This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

apples = "apples"
oranges = "oranges"
fruit = (apples == oranges)
print(fruit)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

a = 3
b =7
c = (a == b)
print(c)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

d = 8
e = 9
f = (d > e)
print(f)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

g = 1
h = 2
i = (g < h)
print(i)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

j = 4
k = 5
l = (j >= k)
print(l)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

m = 6
n = 3
o = (m <= n)
print(o)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

string = "sun"
weather = "clouds"
sky = (string == wheather)
print(sky)
